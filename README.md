LOADSTRING:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bart3kk/funky-friday-autoplay/main/script.lua'))()
```

Basically the up to date version of Funky Friday autoplayer script. I've made it a loadstring, cuz of update purposes (I don't want to spam new script when I fix a simple issue)

Supports:
- Atlantis (WIP, finally a good free exec for y'all üôè)
- Wave
- Arceus X
- Codex
- Delta
- Trigon
- Evon
- Vega X
- Hydrogen

Does NOT support:
- Wave Lite (idfk what they messed up but its so bad rn it fails on a debug value cuz of a CClosure)
- Fluxus (literally fails on a PRINTüíÄ)
- Solara
- Celery (the main deal or every exec that utilizes their API)
- Incognito (is it even still developed)
- Lunar
- Vulkan Beta (discontinued)
and every free PC exploit you can imagine (at least for now)

Exit scam shamewall:
- Electron V3 - Fake story about Hyperion V5 (there was no update lmao)

(Disclaimer: I am the original owner of this repo and anyone that reposts this claiming it's theirs is just faking it. Also I'd strongly advice against executing those copies, because they can contain malicious code)
