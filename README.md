Basically the up to date version of my Funky Friday autoplayer script. I've made it a loadstring, cuz of update purposes (I don't want to spam new script when I fix a simple issue)

Supports:
- Electron V3
- Codex
- Delta
- Trigon
- Evon
- Vega X
- Arceus X
- Hydrogen

Does NOT support:
- Wave Lite (LIT FAILS ON A DEBUG VALUE WHICH IS REQUIRED)
- Fluxus (literally fails on a PRINTðŸ’€)
- Solara
- Celery (the main deal or every exec that utilizes their API)
- Incognito (is it even still developed)
- Lunar
and every free PC exploit you can imagine (at least for now)

Not sure:
- Wave 

(Disclaimer: I am the original owner of this repo and anyone that reposts this claiming it's theirs is just faking it. Also I'd strongly advice against executing those copies, because they can contain malicious code (ESPECIALLY OBFUSCATED ONES))
